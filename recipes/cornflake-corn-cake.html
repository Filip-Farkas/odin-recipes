    <p><h3>Description</h3></p>
    <p>Chef John's cornflake corn cake recipe makes a moister, sweeter version of cornbread using one
         surprising ingredientâ€”cornflakes. It really is a cake, with a texture that is just amazing.

         <p><h3>Ingredients</h3></p>
         <p><ul><li>1 teaspoon butter to grease pan</li>
                <li>1 large egg</li>
                <li>1/2 cup white sugar</li>
                <li>6 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted</li>
                <li>1/2 cup plain yogurt</li>
                <li>1/2 cup milk</li>
                <li>1/2 cup cornmeal</li>
                <li>1 cup all-purpose flour</li>
                <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
                <li>1 1/2 teaspoons baking powder</li>
                <li>1/4 teaspoon baking soda</li>
                <li>2 1/2 cups cornflakes, divided</li>
            </ul></p>
            <p><h3>Steps</h3></p>
            <p><ol>
                <li>Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Grease a 9-inch round cake pan 
                    generously with 1 teaspoon butter, and place a circle of parchment in the bottom. </li>
                <li>Whisk egg and sugar together in a bowl until light and fluffy, about 1 minute. 
                    Whisk in melted butter, yogurt, and milk until combined.</li>
                <li>Add cornmeal, flour, salt, baking powder, and baking soda to egg mixture; whisk 
                    until dry ingredients are moistened. Fold in 2 cups of the cornflakes with a 
                    spatula. Transfer batter to the prepared pan, and smooth the top. </li>
                <li>Scatter remaining 1/2 cup cornflakes evenly over the top; press in lightly with your fingers. </li>
                <li>Bake in the preheated oven until a skewer inserted near the center comes out clean, 
                    about 25 minutes.</li>
                <li>Cool cake in the pan for 15 to 20 minutes before removing to a plate. Cool 
                    completely before serving with fresh fruit or a fruit sauce.</li>
